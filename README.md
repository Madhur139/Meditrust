# MediTrust

**AI-Powered Prescription & Healthcare Platform**

MediTrust is a full-stack healthcare platform where patients can upload a prescription, get it automatically read and structured using AI, check medicine availability on the platform (with alternatives from other companies), book doctor appointments, book pathology/lab tests, and chat for basic health guidance — all in one place.

Built and maintained by **Yaasir Sheikh**.

## Overview

MediTrust solves a simple but common problem: patients receive a prescription, often handwritten, and have no easy way to understand what's written, whether the medicines are available nearby, or how to act on it (book a doctor follow-up, get a lab test done, ask a quick question). MediTrust brings all of this into a single connected flow.

**In one sentence:** Upload a prescription → get it explained → order what's available → book what's needed → ask what's unclear.

## Core Features

### 1. Prescription Upload & AI Extraction

- Patient uploads a photo of a prescription (printed or handwritten)
- Gemini API extracts structured data: medicine name, dosage, frequency, duration
- Low-confidence extractions are flagged for manual review instead of guessed
- Extracted medicines are fuzzy-matched against the platform's medicine database

### 2. Medicine Availability & Alternatives

- Checks if each prescribed medicine is available on MediTrust
- If unavailable: shows a suggested external link to search/purchase elsewhere
- Always shows alternative brands carrying the same generic/salt composition, so users aren't locked into one company

### 3. Doctor Appointment Booking

- Browse doctors by specialization
- View available time slots and book appointments
- Doctors manage their own availability via a dedicated panel

### 4. Pathology / Lab Test Booking

- Browse available tests and diagnostic labs
- Book a test slot (with optional home sample collection)
- Pathologists manage test catalogs and bookings via their own panel

### 5. Basic Health Chat (AI-Assisted)

- Chat window for general, non-diagnostic health questions
- Implemented via polling (periodic REST calls), not WebSockets — simpler and sufficient for this use case
- AI is explicitly restricted: no diagnosis, no dosage recommendations
- Always nudges toward booking a real doctor consultation for anything specific

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**

- React (Vite)
- Redux Toolkit — global/auth state
- TanStack Query — server state & caching
- Tailwind CSS — styling

**Backend**

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT — authentication
- Polling (REST) — chat updates, no WebSockets

**AI / External Services**

- Gemini API — prescription extraction (vision + structured output) and health chat
- Cloud storage (e.g. Cloudinary) — prescription image uploads

## AI / Prescription Extraction Flow

```
1. Patient uploads prescription image
        │
        ▼
2. Image sent to Gemini API with a structured-output prompt
   → returns JSON: [{ medicine_name, dosage, frequency, duration, confidence }]
        │
        ▼
3. Each medicine name is fuzzy-matched against the `medicines` collection
        │
        ├── Match found + in stock  → "Available" (add to cart)
        ├── Match found, out of stock → suggested external link
        └── No confident match      → flagged for manual patient/admin review
        │
        ▼
4. Alternatives (same generic name, different company) are shown alongside every matched medicine
```

**Safety principle:** the AI never silently guesses. Anything below a confidence threshold is surfaced to the user as "unclear — please verify" rather than auto-filled.

## Database Design (Key Collections)

```
User            { name, email, password, role, phone }
Doctor          { userId, specialization, fee, availableSlots[] }
Pathologist     { userId, labName, testsOffered[] }
Prescription    { patientId, imageUrl, extractedData[], status, uploadedAt }
Medicine        { name, genericName, company, price, stock, category }
Appointment     { patientId, doctorId, slotTime, status }
TestBooking     { patientId, pathologistId, testId, slotTime, status }
Test            { name, pathologistId, price }
ChatMessage     { senderId, receiverId/sessionId, message, isAI, timestamp }
```

Medicine alternatives are resolved at query time by matching `genericName` across different `company` values — no separate mapping table required.
